# Mocha, Chai, and JavaScript TDD Kata

This project uses the Mocha and Chai libraries for Test-Driven Development (TDD) to solve simple kata problems in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/CarringtonCreative/urban-octo-journey.git

Install the dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.

Run the tests with npm test.

## Running Tests

Tests are located in the test directory and are named with the .test.js extension. Write your tests in these files following the Mocha and Chai syntax.

## Pushing Code

Code is located in the src directory. Write your code in these files following the problem statement. Make sure that the code passes the tests by running npm test after writing.

## Resources

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - JavaScript test framework
[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - Assertion library for Mocha
[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) - Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.
